# PythonPrograms

This program prompts the user to enter x and y coordinates. Afterwards, it will plot the coordinates on a scatterplot with the help of 
the polyfit function from the numpy package. Then, it will plot the line of best fit for all the points using the linspace function. 
In the end, the resulting graph will be plotted with the help of matplotlib package and will be displayed using the show function.
